## npm (Node Package Manager):

`npm` is a package manager for JavaScript that comes bundled with Node.js.
It's used to install, manage, and share packages or libraries of code with others. These packages can include JavaScript code, modules, and other project dependencies.
You typically use npm to install packages globally or locally within a project. It also helps you manage versions and dependencies for your projects.

## npx (Node Package Execute)

npx is a package runner tool that also comes with npm (version 5.2.0 and higher). It's not a typo; it's "npx"!
It's used to execute packages from the npm registry. You can run commands directly from packages that you haven't installed globally or locally.
npx is especially handy for running packages that you might not need to keep installed on your system, or for running one-off commands without cluttering your global or project dependencies.

## Difference:
The main difference is that npm is primarily used for package management and installing dependencies, while npx is used for executing packages, especially when you want to run a specific command from a package without installing it globally or locally.

For example, you might use npm to install libraries like React or Express in your project, and then you'd use npx to run development scripts or tools that are part of those libraries without needing to install them separately.
